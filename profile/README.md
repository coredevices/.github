# Welcome!

We are the company behind the next generation of Pebble. Learn more at [rePebble.com](https://rePebble.com) and on [Eric's blog](https://ericmigi.com). 

The new Pebble smartwatches are powered by 100% open source software. You can download, modify, compile and load your own custom software on your watch. That's pretty cool.
